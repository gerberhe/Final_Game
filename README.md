#Final_Game

##Setup
```sh
$ bundle install
```

##Opening the Game

```sh
1) Right click anywhere in folder, "Git Bash"
2) Type in the following command:
$ ruby main.rb
```

##Objective of the Game
```sh
Your objective is to avoid all obstacles moving towards you by
moving in the correct direction away from that obstacle as
indicated by that obstacle's corresponding arrow. This arrow
will always point you in the correct direction, and should
you fail to go this direction, you will lose.

Colliding with any obstacle also causes you to lose.

Your score is based upon how long you are able to survive in
this game. The game will progressively get faster as you
survive for longer and longer in space, up to a certain extent
(upon reaching this point, it is near impossible to continue
if the game gets any faster).


Have fun, and try to get the highest score you can!
